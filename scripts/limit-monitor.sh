# Claude usage-limit monitor (token-free, systemd --user timer).
#
# WHY bash and not a Claude scheduled-task: a Claude agent invocation itself
# consumes the very quota we're guarding. This runs as a plain shell script,
# greps for limit signals, and alerts the owner via the Telegram Bot API.
# Zero Claude tokens.
#
# Signals: rate-limit / usage-limit / 429 / "resets at" in the channels+dashboard
# logs AND in the live tmux panes of the WHOLE fleet (where Claude Code prints
# the limit banner). Dedupes via a state hash so the same event isn't re-alerted.
#
# Two things measured on 2026-08-18 shaped this:
#   - The plan quota is shared by every agent on the subscription, but the
#     banner is printed in whichever pane made the request that hit it. Watching
#     only the main channels pane means a sub-agent can hit the wall silently.
#   - The wordings closest to what the owner actually asks about ("5-hour limit
#     reached", "Approaching Opus weekly limit", "Session limit reached") did
#     NOT match the old pattern. A missed limit is silent; that is the failure
#     that matters here, so the pattern errs wide and the pane match is confined
#     to the bottom region instead.
