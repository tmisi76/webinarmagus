# Token-free IDLE-path keepalive producer (systemd --user timer on Linux,
# launchd StartInterval on macOS via install-channel-keepalive-probe.sh --
# every 3 min, see scripts/systemd/channel-keepalive-probe.timer).
#
# WHY: the keepalive freshness signal (store/.channel-keepalive mtime) has two
# intended producers:
#   1. organic inbound  -- channel-monitor advances the mtime on every ingested
#      message (refreshKeepaliveFromInbound). Covers BUSY periods, token-free.
#   2. an IDLE-path keep-alive -- historically a scheduled Telegram MCP
#      edit_message round-trip run inside the channels TUI every ~6 min, which
#      touched the file REGARDLESS of traffic. That scheduled task went missing
#      (regression since #372), so during QUIET periods neither producer fires,
#      the file goes stale past channel-watchdog's 15-min threshold, and the
#      watchdog false-respawns a healthy-but-idle session every ~30 min. Each
#      needless respawn re-opens/wedges the /mcp menu -- the visible symptom.
#
# This script restores producer #2 WITHOUT a model round-trip (token-free): it
# proves the channel is genuinely alive from the PROCESS TREE and only then
# advances the keepalive. If the pipe is truly dead it does NOT touch, so the
# watchdog still legitimately respawns a real wedge.
#
# Liveness proof (all must hold): the ${id}-channels tmux session exists, its
# claude pid is alive, and a telegram plugin poller (bun|node under a
# /telegram/ plugin dir) descends from that claude. Ancestry is verified so a
# stray poller from another context cannot mask a dead main-session pipe.
