    # Idempotent launch. On WSL two independent autostart hooks can reach this
    # script on the same boot -- the wsl.conf [boot] command and a Windows
    # ONLOGON task -- and a plain relaunch would put a second dashboard on the
    # same port and, far worse, a second channels.sh polling the same bot token,
    # which splits incoming messages between two pollers with no error anywhere.
    # flock serializes the two hooks; the pidfile checks below make the loser a
    # no-op. fd 9 is closed in the children so the lock is released when this
    # script exits, not when the daemons do.
    #
    # The critical section is "ensure built, THEN ensure running". `npm run build`
    # writes into the shared dist/, so two hooks arriving on the same boot would
    # otherwise run two concurrent compilers over the same output and the loser
    # could launch from a half-written dist/index.js. A full build of this project
    # measures ~10s here, well inside the wait below.
    #
    # The lock is taken on store/ ITSELF, so it introduces no file of its own.
    # It is deliberately NOT taken on a pidfile: stop.sh unlinks those, and flock
    # binds to the inode, not the name -- so a lock held on an unlinked pidfile
    # silently stops being a mutex. Measured 2026-09-02: with the pidfile removed
    # mid-flight the waiting hook's `exec 9>` created a FRESH inode, flock
    # returned at once, and both hooks entered the critical section together.
    # This is also not the mkdir-style "lock directory" idiom, which really does
    # leave an orphaned lock behind after kill -9; here the directory is only an
    # fd and carries no state, and the kernel drops the flock when the holder
    # dies -- on kill -9 and on power loss alike -- so no boot can inherit a
    # stale lock.
    #
    # Every way of NOT getting the lock says so. The bug this guard exists for is
    # invisible by nature -- two pollers splitting one bot's messages, with no
    # error anywhere -- so silently running without the guard would reintroduce
    # exactly the failure it prevents, minus the evidence. Falling through is
    # still the right choice: the pidfile checks below are the actual protection,
    # and refusing to start would risk leaving the box with nothing running.
    #
    # "Already running" is decided from the pidfile, NOT from `pgrep -f`. An
    # existence check on the process table cannot tell a live service from one
    # that is still winding down, and stop.sh's callers hit exactly that: the
    # update finalizer runs stop.sh then start.sh back to back, so a pgrep check
    # sees the dying dashboard, skips the launch, and leaves the box with
    # nothing running once it finally exits -- the update then fails its health
    # check and rolls back. stop.sh removes the pidfile once the process is
    # confirmed gone, so a deliberate stop is unambiguous here. The pid is
    # cross-checked against /proc/<pid>/cmdline because a pidfile that survived a
    # reboot can point at an unrelated recycled pid.
