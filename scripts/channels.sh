# Supports Telegram (default) and Slack providers. The provider is read
# from CHANNEL_PROVIDER in .env; when absent, defaults to "telegram" for
# full backward compatibility.
#
# A LaunchAgent (macOS) vagy a systemd user unit (Linux) hívja. Működés:
# 1. Tmux session indul a claude processzel
# 2. A script vár amíg a session él
# 3. Ha a claude kilép, a tmux session záródik, a script is kilép
# 4. A launchd KeepAlive újraindítja -- kilépési kódtól függetlenül.
#    A systemd oldalon ez NEM volt igaz: a unit Restart=always nélkül a nulla
#    kilépési kódot "kész, nem kell újraindítani"-ként olvasta, így a csatorna
#    némán, véglegesen leállt. Ezért ad a watchdog-ág mostantól nem-nulla kódot,
#    és ezért Restart=always a unit -- a két platform szemantikája így egyezik.
#
# Kézzel rácsatlakozás: tmux attach -t <MAIN_AGENT_ID>-channels (pl. marveen-channels)

# Takes a captured pane as $1 and sets MCP_PLUGIN_STATE (failed|ok) plus the row

# live tmux session (see scripts/__tests__/channels-mcp-unlock.test.sh) -- the
# previous inline matcher went stale against a Claude Code TUI change and no
# test could have caught it.
#
# Only the plugin's OWN row is considered, and only the status word decides:
#   - The row label is the MCP server id, not the marketplace id. Claude Code
#     2.1.159 rendered `plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official`, 2.1.220
#     renders `plugin:telegram:telegram`. Both are accepted.
#   - The failure marker moved from `✗ Failed` (U+2717, capitalised) to
#     `✘ failed` (U+2718, lowercase), so the glyph is not matched at all. The
#     status vocabulary mirrors PLUGIN_FAILED_RX in
#     src/web/channel-health-monitor.ts.
# The status-marker pre-filter keeps a scrollback mention of the plugin id (the
# "Listening for channel messages from:" banner) from being read as the /mcp
# row; `tail -1` prefers the menu, which renders at the bottom of the pane.

# Why: this script has SEVEN `exit 0` paths and channels-failures.log, true to

# anywhere (measured on hermes 2026-09-09 20:25:03: the service's main process
# exited 0, systemd's Restart=on-failure did not restart it, and the box lost
# its supervisor with nothing to read afterwards; journald had no line either,
# because leftover cgroup processes suppressed the usual "Deactivated" record).
# Marveen's ordering decision (msg 23453): exit LOGGING lands first; only then
# is a Restart-policy change even discussable, because until the exit is
# measured, `on-failure` is the last remaining signal.
#
# Scope, stated: an EXIT trap covers every code-path exit (explicit `exit N`,
# end-of-script, `set -e`-style aborts) but NOT an untrapped fatal signal --
# systemd/launchd already record "code=killed, signal=..." in that case, so
# the invisible class was precisely the clean self-exit this closes.
#
# Placed AFTER the test seams above (their contract is "no tmux / store /
# session" -- a trap before them would make every seam invocation write into
# the repo's store/). Growth is bounded by service lifecycle frequency (the
# chronic hermes churn is ~36 exits/day, a few KB); no rotation needed.

# allowedChannelPlugins and SILENTLY DROPS notifications from any plugin not

# MCP startup-batch tuning for the MAIN session (2026-06-26).
#
# The --channels telegram plugin registers as a stdio MCP server. Claude Code
# connects stdio MCP servers in batches of MCP_SERVER_CONNECTION_BATCH_SIZE
# (default 3) and, by default, blocks on each connection. The main session runs
# the MOST MCP servers of any agent (filesystem + playwright + chrome + the
# claude.ai Gmail/Calendar/Drive connectors + the channel plugin), so the slow
# remote connectors starve the telegram plugin out of the startup batch / push
# it past MCP_TIMEOUT -- it never registers, no poller spawns, and the main bot
# goes silent (observed 2026-06-26: ~2h outage, auto-recovery exhausted).
#
# startAgentProcess already sets these for every sub-agent (which is why their
# channels come up); channels.sh did NOT, so the main session never got the
# mitigation. Set them inline on the launch command -- the tmux SERVER predates
# this script and does not inherit its environment, so exporting here alone
# would not reach the new claude. Mirrors the sub-agent launch.
#
# CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false also added here: the sub-agent spawn
# (startAgentProcess) sets it to suppress the DIM ghost-text autocomplete, but
# the MAIN channels session never got it -- so a dim ghost in the main box was
# the one place the pane-scrape recovery could still misread it (the v1.15.0
# dim-strip catches it on the recovery side, but killing it at the SOURCE on MAIN
# too closes the gap end-to-end). Parity with the sub-agent launch.

# By default the main channels agent keeps the shared ~/.claude and

# -- the ROTATING macOS Keychain OAuth session, or (Linux) the shared
# ~/.claude/.credentials.json -- both periodically expire and 401 the main bot
# ("Please run /login"), while the isolated sub-agents (long-lived fleet
# setup-token) never do (confirmed root cause of the 2026-07-23 marveen-channels
# silent outage). The helper provisions an isolated CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (same code
# path as the sub-agents, via dist/web/agent-process.js) and authenticates the
# main agent from the fleet setup-token instead.
#
# The decision lives ENTIRELY in the helper, which prints "<mode>\t<path>" (or
# nothing) and covers the two mutually exclusive ways the main agent can get its
# own CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:
#
#   explicit -- MAIN_AGENT_CONFIG_DIR points at an EXISTING dir the operator has
#     already logged into (the bot has its OWN Claude account, separate from the
#     fleet's). That dir carries its own .credentials.json, so we must NOT inject
#     the fleet token: doing so would authenticate the bot as the fleet. Works on
#     every platform.
#   isolated -- MAIN_AGENT_ISOLATED_CONFIG=1 (any platform) with a fleet
#     setup-token: the helper provisions a credential-less dir and we export the
#     fleet token (same code path as the sub-agents), so the bot stops depending
#     on the rotating/shared on-disk credential.
#
# Both settings resolve through the settings-store (dashboard toggle in
# store/config-overrides.json OR a hand-set .env key -- resolution override>.env>
# default), and explicit wins over isolated. When neither applies the helper
# prints nothing, CFG_ENV stays EMPTY and the agent keeps the shared ~/.claude --

# P1 FIX: put the Claude auth token into the tmux SERVER global env BEFORE
# new-session. A new session inherits the tmux SERVER's global environment, not
# this shell's. The tmux server is SHARED across every agent, so if a sub-agent
# created the server first, this shell's `export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (above)
# never reaches the channels claude -> "Not logged in" until the hourly restart.
# Setting it -g makes the launch order irrelevant. Safe to share globally: every
# agent uses the same Claude login (unlike the channel tokens scrubbed above,
# which DO conflict and are -u'd).
#
# `start-server` first, because the "no server yet -> new-session inherits this
# shell's env" assumption below is only safe when NOTHING ELSE creates the
# server in between. At boot it does: systemd starts marveen-channels and
# marveen-dashboard in the same second, and the dashboard's worker sessions win
# the race about half the time. Then `set-environment -g` silently no-ops (no
# server), the dashboard creates the server WITHOUT the token, and our
# new-session inherits that empty global env instead of this shell's -- the
# channels claude comes up "Not logged in - Please run /login" and the Telegram
# plugin dies in a restart loop, on a headless box where /login is impossible.
# Creating the server ourselves makes set-environment -g always land, which is
# what the fix intended. start-server is idempotent and cheap.

# POST-INIT PLUGIN UNLOCK (2026-06-01 Szabi 15:24 incident workaround):
# Claude Code 2.1.159 + telegram-plugin 0.0.6: the `--channels` parameter
# announces "Listening for channel messages from: plugin:telegram@..." in the
# TUI, but the plugin server itself is NOT always spawned on fresh-session
# init - it lands in /mcp's Failed state with no bun-poller child. Manually
# opening /mcp, moving the cursor up to the failed plugin row, and pressing
# Enter twice (enter submenu, press Reconnect) brings the plugin live -
# Szabi's empirical sequence that fixed the 16:31 hard-restart aftermath.
#
# Two-stage detection, both must indicate "no plugin" before we fire keystrokes:
#
#   1. pgrep -P claude_pid bun   -- looks for a bun child of the marveen-channels
#      claude process. This catches the case the env-var grep misses: Claude Code
#      does NOT inherit TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR into the spawned poller on the main
#      session (only on sub-agents), so an env-var-needle scan reports "no
#      poller" even when one is running. A direct child-of-claude pgrep is the
#      authoritative signal.
#
#   2. capture-pane after `/mcp` shows the plugin's own row in a failed state.
#      Connected/Enabled rows must NOT trigger the keystroke sequence, because
#      then `Up`+`Enter`+`Enter` would land on "Disable" in the submenu and
#      disable the plugin instead of reconnecting it (Szabi msg 427).
#
# We sequence the checks, log the decision, and fire only when all agree.
# The subshell is detached so the main script keeps moving to the wait-loop.
#
# MCPDUP806 hardening (2026-08-06, fresh-0.3.9 incident): the round is
# bracketed by input-line proofs.
#   - PRE-FLIGHT: "/mcp" is only typed into a PROVABLY empty idle prompt.
#     Into any other pane state the literal text parks in the input box, the
#     next boot's probe appends to it ("/mcp/mcp"), the combined text gets
#     submitted as a prompt, and while parked it reads as busy to the message
#     router -- muting inter-agent delivery to the main session.
#   - END-OF-ROUND: Escape-until-idle (a single Escape from the per-plugin
#     submenu only pops one level -- the list stays open), then, if our own
#     "/mcp" residue is still parked, one Ctrl-C (the measured clear for a
#     parked line; C-u and Escape verifiably do not empty it) and a final
#     probe. The log records the PROVEN end state, never the intent.
#   - EFFECT: after a fired unlock the bun-poller check re-runs and the log
#     records whether the plugin actually came up -- a green "firing unlock"
#     line alone said nothing about whether the fix landed.

# likely a config error (bad token, missing plugin, auth issue). We log the
# failure and exit non-zero so the service manager's own back-off kicks in
# instead of tight-looping and burning API tokens.
START_TS=$(date +%s)

# Plugin liveness watchdog (main channels session only) -- a last-resort
# backstop UNDER the dashboard channel-monitor, not a replacement. The monitor
# is the primary recovery, but its down-state lives in dashboard process
# memory: a plugin that dies WHILE THE DASHBOARD ITSELF IS RESTARTING is missed
# (the in-memory state machine resets and never re-detects it). This in-session
# shell watchdog is independent of the dashboard. If the channel bot process
# (tracked via the plugin's bot.pid) never comes up, OR comes up and then stays
# dead, we exit so the service manager (launchd/systemd) restarts us with a
# fresh Claude + plugin.
#
# Thresholds are deliberately COARSER than the dashboard monitor's (~60-120s)
# so in normal operation the dashboard acts FIRST and this only fires when the
# dashboard couldn't -- avoids double-restart races. bot.pid lives in the
# main-agent state dir -- install-scoped since the #915 migration above, which
# has already run by the time this executes (see src/channel-provider.ts
# channelStateDir() for the matching server-side resolution).
MAIN_BOT_PID_FILE="$MAIN_CHAN_DIR/bot.pid"
# Never-started budget: generous so a slow cold-start (WSL first-run, MCP
# handshake + /mcp unlock retries) is never killed prematurely. The plugin
# normally writes bot.pid within ~1-2 min; 10 min is a safe ceiling.
#
# The budget GROWS across consecutive restarts, and that is the point. On a host
# where the plugin cannot start at all -- AVX-less box, broken plugin cache,
# Claude auth deferred at install -- a fixed 10-minute budget becomes a
# ten-minute restart cycle that never ends. Each restart kill-sessions and
# recreates the agent's tmux session, so on a machine where Claude itself works
# and only the plugin is dead, the main agent loses its context every ten
# minutes. Measured on a live host on 2026-08-04: exit 1 at 08:23:52, systemd
# restart at 08:24:03, fresh session at 08:24:04, and the same again one budget
# later. Before the watchdog exited non-zero that host simply kept a working
# agent with a dead channel -- so an unbounded cycle would be a regression for
# that population, not an improvement.
#
# What is deliberately NOT damped: the signal. The warning still goes to the log
# and the exit is still non-zero, so the service manager still restarts the unit
# and OnFailure= still fires. We slow the churn down; we do not silence the
# symptom. A host that recovers resets the streak, so a healthy machine keeps
# the original fast watchdog.
