# Ensure the SYSTEM-level Claude Code managed-settings.json enables channels.
#
# WHY: claude-code >= 2.1.205 SILENTLY drops channel-plugin INBOUND
# notifications on a TEAM/ENTERPRISE org unless the managed (org-policy) settings
# contain "channelsEnabled": true. The bot still sends OUTBOUND and the poller
# still runs (pending 0), so it looks "almost working" -- but replies never reach
# the session (plugin log: "Channel notifications skipped: channels not enabled
# by org policy"). channelsEnabled is a MANAGED-settings-only key; user/project
# settings have no effect. See the channel-inbound-org-policy-gate skill.
#
# ALWAYS-ENSURE (not org-type detection): on a personal org the key is simply
# ignored (harmless), and an account can move personal -> team AFTER install, so
# detecting org type at install time is fragile. Setting it unconditionally in
# the managed layer is the simple, robust, correct-for-all-cases choice.
#
# Idempotent, reversible (delete the key), and a SAFE JSON merge (never sed):
# existing managed keys -- e.g. allowedChannelPlugins -- are preserved.
#
# Managed-settings paths (authoritative, code.claude.com/docs/en/settings.md):
#   macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json
#   Linux/WSL: /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json

# Answering "is this already configured?" is a READ, and the managed file is org
# policy (0644, not a secret), so ask it with NO privilege and ask it BEFORE the
# sudo handling below. Resolving sudo first meant a host where the key was
# ALREADY set, but the invoking user had no sudo, reported

# $1 is the privilege prefix ("" or sudo). No `[ -f ]` guard: absent and
# unreadable are the same answer here, and that test would itself need the
# privilege we may not have.
