# Contract tests for the idle-path keepalive probe's INSTALLATION.
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/keepalive-probe-install.test.sh
#
# Bug being locked out (measured on a live install, night of 2026-09-12/13:
# 13 service restarts, one every ~50 minutes, midnight to morning):
# scripts/channel-keepalive-probe.sh and its placeholder units under
# scripts/systemd/ shipped for weeks, but NOTHING installed them. So the only
# producer of store/.channel-keepalive freshness was organic inbound traffic,
# and a quiet night became indistinguishable from a wedged session: the file
# aged past the dashboard's 45-minute liveness ceiling, channel-monitor
# respawn-paned a healthy main agent (conversation lost, no --continue), that
# killed the telegram plugin, and channels.sh's dead-plugin watchdog exited 181s
# later for a second, whole-unit restart.
#
# Two separate failure modes, so two separate contracts:
#   1. install-linux.sh must WRITE the units and ENABLE the timer (new installs),
#   2. update.sh must install them on ALREADY INSTALLED machines -- the template
#      alone never reaches the hosts that have the bug today.
#
# Hermetic: update.sh's function is extracted and run against a throwaway units
# dir with a `systemctl` stub on PATH, so nothing on this machine is enabled.
