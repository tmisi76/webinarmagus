# Contract tests for the pane-dead detector in scripts/channels.sh (PANEDEAD919).
#
# Origin (2026-09-19, PR #1402 verify): `remain-on-exit on` keeps a pane whose
# claude died, so `while has-session` never ends and a dead main channel waits
# out the 180s plugin-dead grace (600-2400s on a cold-start crash) instead of
# the seconds the session-gone path used to take. The detector must:
#   - report dead on a positive pane_dead=1 (single or any pane),
#   - report alive on 0,
#   - report alive when tmux itself fails (fail-safe: no restart on a broken
#     instrument),
# and the suite must be able to go red: CHANNELS_BIN points it at a copy.
# Driven through `channels.sh --pane-dead-check <session>` with a fake tmux
# (CHANNELS_TMUX_BIN); nothing here touches a real tmux server.
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/channels-pane-dead.test.sh
