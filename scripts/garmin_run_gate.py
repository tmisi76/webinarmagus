"""Token-free gate in front of the garmin-run-watcher heartbeat.

The watcher used to be a `type: heartbeat` task: every tick woke Seven with a
prompt whose first step was to run running_analysis.py and fall silent when it
printed "Mar elemezve". Measured over 7 days that was 100% of the ticks -- a
model call per tick to learn that nothing happened. This script makes the
no-op path cost nothing and only wakes Seven when there is something to judge.

Exit-code contract of running_analysis.py (read from the source, not guessed --
running_analysis.py:157-196):

    main() -> 0  ... no runs at all, or latest run already analysed
    main() -> 1  ... NEW run; analysis written to pending_run_analysis.txt AND
                     last_analyzed_run.json advanced
    sys.exit(0 if result == 0 else 2)

so the process exits 0 for "nothing to do" and 2 for "new run". An uncaught
exception (Garmin login failure, network) exits 1. The codes already
discriminate, so we do NOT string-match the Hungarian output: those strings are
accented and inconsistent ("Mar elemezve" vs "Uj futas talalva") and a locale
or wording change would silently turn every tick into "nothing new".

WHY A CRASH IS NOT exit 0. The task spec asked for "already analysed OR error
-> exit 0". Folding the error branch into the silent branch would disarm the
failure alert this task is supposed to have: a broken Garmin login would look
exactly like "no new run" forever, and the 7-day/0-hit statistic could not tell
the two apart retrospectively. Crashes exit non-zero so failThreshold reports
them.

WHY WE ROLL THE STATE BACK. running_analysis.py advances
last_analyzed_run.json *before* anyone has been told about the run. If the
notify POST then fails (dashboard down, token rotated), the next tick reports
"already analysed" and that run is never assessed -- the marker would record
the attempt instead of the success, the same failure shape we just fixed in the
intel rhythm markers. So we snapshot the state file first and restore it when
the notify fails, which makes the whole gate idempotent: the next tick simply
finds the run again.
