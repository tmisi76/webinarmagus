"""Level-aware email approval gate for the MAIN agent (EMAILKAPU901 PR2).

Wired in the repo's .claude/settings.json (PreToolUse: Bash + *send_email* +
*manage_email*), i.e. for sessions rooted at PROJECT_ROOT -- the main agent.
Sub-agents keep their unconditional hard-deny (scripts/email-send-gate.mjs in
their own settings); a sub-agent session that also loads this hook is still
blocked by that one, so this gate can never widen sub-agent rights.

The `email_send.level` in store/autonomy-config.json becomes a real switch:
  level 1  -> hard deny (signal-only autonomy).
  level 2  -> CHECK-BEFORE-SEND: the send is allowed only against an APPROVED,
              UNCONSUMED, IN-WINDOW approval whose content_hash equals the
              sha256 anchor of THIS letter's envelope (to + cc + bcc + subject +
              body). A body+subject hash alone would let an approved letter be
              re-sent to a different recipient -- hence every recipient field, bcc included (msg 17936, EMAILBCCHORGONY903).
  level 3  -> allow (autonomous; the outgoing-copy-gate still audits copy).

Anchor semantics (WebinarMagus msg 17900, 5+1 conditions):
  1. the hash is computed from the SAME extraction the copy gate audits
     (email_extract.collect_email_envelope -- single implementation);
  2. an approval is ONE-SHOT: consumed atomically on allow;
  3. a TIME WINDOW (~30 min from approval) bounds the hash match;
  4. FAIL-CLOSED: unreadable letter, unrecoverable recipient, missing config,
     or unreachable approvals DB all DENY -- "cannot decide" never means
     "allowed";
  5. the deny message hands the agent the exact hash + a readable summary, so
     the approval's action_description is human-readable and the resend can
     only succeed with byte-identical content.

Exit codes (PreToolUse contract): 0 = allow, 2 = block. A crash must never
exit 1 (non-blocking) -- the __main__ net converts it to 2 on send paths.
EVERY malformed input (unparseable stdin included) blocks: unlike the copy
gate, which audits and stays alive on harness faults, this gate authorizes,
so "cannot decide" is always a deny.
