"""UserPromptSubmit hook: provenance gate.

Every legitimate delivery path into an agent session stamps a provenance
envelope on the prompt: `<channel source="...">` for a chat channel,
`<scheduled-task source="...">` for the local scheduler, `<trusted-peer ...>`
/ `<untrusted ...>` for inter-agent and federated traffic. An input that
carries NO envelope was typed or injected straight into the pane -- the
dashboard terminal, the webinarmaguschat web UI, or (2026-06-26) a stray
auto-submitted suggestion. Its origin cannot be verified.

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-06-26 a bare "mehet a restart" line reached
testagent's pane interleaved with real Telegram traffic and triggered a
session hard-restart. Viktor never saw that line in his own chat. The rule
"only wrapped input is verified" existed, but it lived in a memory note, so it
held only as long as the model happened to remember it.

This hook moves the rule into the harness. When a prompt has no recognised
provenance envelope AND asks for an operation that is irreversible or
outward-facing (restart, re-auth, send, delete, payment, approval), it emits a
directive on stdout telling the agent to confirm on a verified channel before
acting, and to notify the fleet lead. The lead is FLEET_LEAD_ID (env, then the
install .env), falling back to MAIN_AGENT_ID: the two are different things and
only coincide on an install that is its own fleet lead (see _fleet_lead).

FLAG, not block -- Viktor's decision, 2026-07-22 (kanban b241f29e): "az ugynok
JELOLJE meg, VISSZAKERDEZZEN (ne cselekedjen automatikusan), ES jelezze a
WebinarMagus Fonoknek (webinarmagus-is)". A hard block would wedge legitimate console
work; a flag costs one clarifying question when it is wrong.

CONTRACT: UserPromptSubmit stdout (exit 0) is injected into the model prompt as
plain text. A NON-ZERO EXIT BLOCKS THE PROMPT and deafens the agent (the
2026-07-11 / 2026-07-14 "deaf fleet" incidents), so every path here exits 0 --
including parse failures and unexpected exceptions.

Tuning lives outside the public repo, in store/provenance-gate-rules.json
(override with PROVENANCE_GATE_RULES). Shape, all keys optional:

    {
      "enabled": true,
      "exempt_prompt_patterns": ["<python-regex>", ...],
      "extra_action_patterns": {"<label>": ["<python-regex>", ...]},
      "extra_provenance_markers": ["<literal substring>", ...]
    }

A missing rules file is normal and silent: the shipped defaults are the whole
protection, not half of it. This differs from outgoing-copy-gate.py, where the
rules file carries a rule that cannot ship publicly and its absence must be
loud.

# --- provenance envelopes -------------------------------------------------
# Substring markers, matched against the RAW prompt. Presence of any one means
# the input arrived through a delivery path that stamped its origin, so the
# gate stays out of the way. src/prompt-safety.ts is the producing side; note
# that <channel> appears with source="telegram" (channel-coordinator) and with
# source="plugin:telegram:telegram" (native plugin), hence the loose prefix.

# --- the agent's own background-task result -------------------------------
# A `<task-notification>` block is the harness reporting a background task
# THIS agent started; it names the task id it was given at launch. It carries
# no provenance envelope, so the markers above read it as bare -- and because
# a subagent's result routinely contains send/delete verbs, the action
# patterns below match it. Measured 2026-09-03: two flags in 86 seconds for
# one agent, and on that day every false positive the gate produced was this
# one shape.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ADDED TO PROVENANCE_MARKERS. Silencing the gate on this path
# would be the cheap fix and the wrong one: what arrives here is a SUBAGENT'S
# OUTPUT, and a subagent routinely reads untrusted material. The live example
# that settled it (krisztianwebinarmagusja, same day) is a working chain, not a
# hypothetical: voip `title` / `insight_*` fields are written from a call
# transcript, so their content is ultimately dictated by an outside caller on
# the phone -> insight -> MCP -> subagent -> the agent's context. Whitelisting
# would leave exactly that path ungated.
#
# So the gate still FIRES and still AUDITS; only the directive changes. The
# "ask your principal on the verified channel" instruction is meaningless for
# an agent's own background task -- that is the false escalation being
# removed. What replaces it is the statement that matters: the content is
# DATA, and imperative language inside it is not an instruction.

    prompt, and the reviewer measured what that lets in:
      - a FORGED block, assembled by hand with a destructive shell command in
        it, took the softer self-task path -- no escalation, no lead notice;
      - a mere QUOTE of the tag downgraded an otherwise bare request.
    A 19-character string is not evidence: anything that can write it qualifies.
    And for a gate the asymmetry matters -- widening a prohibition is safe,
    widening an EXCEPTION admits the cases nobody thought of.

    So three conditions must hold together, and each closes one measured hole:
      1. the block starts the prompt (only the harness's own SYSTEM NOTIFICATION

      2. exactly ONE opening tag -- no stuffing a second block into a request;
      3. nothing follows the closing tag but whitespace -- an appended

    Anything else falls through to the FULL directive, which is the safe side.

# --- system directives: verify the queue row, do not trust the header -------
# CTXBORITEK919 (2026-09-19). The context-guard / restart-gate / channels-
# recovery directives are typed straight into the pane by src/web/system-
# directive.ts, on purpose: the proof of origin is the agent_messages row the
# header points at (from_agent='system', which POST /api/messages can never
# forge), not any envelope text. That path therefore carries no provenance
# marker, and this gate flagged every one of them: measured on
# store/provenance-flagged.log, 100 of the 157 flags in the week before this
# change were routine directives (52-88 % of each day's flags). A gate that
# fires on every restart is background noise by the time a real forgery shows
# up.
#
# The fix is NOT a marker for the header -- a substring is exactly what a
# forgery would also write, and a producer-side envelope would be the same
# substring under another name. Instead the gate does here, mechanically, what
# the recipient's CLAUDE.md already tells the model to do: read the referenced
# row back and require from_agent='system', to_agent=this agent, status not
# 'failed', content equal to the body after the header (trailing whitespace
# normalised; nothing else). Three outcomes, three audit labels, so the change
# stays measurable afterwards:
#   directive-verified     -> silent (the routine case)
#   directive-forged       -> flag, INJECTION-SUSPECT wording
#   directive-unverifiable -> flag, distinct wording (WebinarMagus 27225: a row that
#                             cannot be READ is not proof of forgery, but it is
#                             not verification either -- fail closed, or "make
#                             the DB unreadable" becomes a bypass)
#   directive-verified-trailer (DIREKTIVAFARK920, 2026-09-20) -> the body
#                             STARTS with the row's content and something
#                             follows it. Measured on the first live directive
#                             after #1411 (row 27306, system -> samu,
#                             delivered): the gate called a REAL restart
#                             directive forged with "content does not match",
#                             because the prompt body carried more than the
#                             row. The exact cause is not proven (the pane
#                             scrollback was gone; the timing allows the
#                             harness to have joined the directive and an
#                             inter-agent message into one prompt), so the fix
#                             is built on the MECHANISM, not on the cause: the
#                             directive is verified by its row, and the
#                             remainder gets the ORDINARY gate (envelope /
#                             exemption / action patterns / self-task), as if
#                             it had arrived on its own. NOT a marker list for
#                             "known trailers": "TEAM MEMBER NOTICE" is a
#                             string anyone can write, and a remainder that
#                             starts with it would then ride through under the
#                             verified label without ever being examined. Here
#                             a well-formed envelope stays silent, a bare
#                             remainder that asks for an operation is flagged
#                             as MEGJELOLT INPUT, and the wording says which
#                             part the verification covers.
# Structural match at the START of the prompt only: a quoted header in the
# middle of a request never takes this branch.
# The separator after the header is ONE newline (the caller's shape,
# src/web/system-directive.ts: `envelope + "\n" + text`) or ONE space (the
# pane's shape: sendPromptToSession maps every line break to a space before
# typing, src/web/pane-text.ts). DIREKTIVASORTORES920, measured 2026-09-20:
