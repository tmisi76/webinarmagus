#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Scheduler preCheck for the webinarmagus-io-kozosseg-orszem task (ORSICTX912).
#
# runPreCheck contract: exit 0 + stdout "SKIP" = no model turn this tick;
# exit 0 + other stdout = run the task with stdout as a context prefix;
# non-zero exit / timeout (10s spawnSync) = fail-open, the model turn runs.
#
# Why: the hourly sentinel round re-injects its full SKILL.md (~3.5k tokens of
# a 12-23k token round) and MOST hours have nothing new -- the saturation
# arithmetic (Orsi: 2.5 context restarts/day, each a message-loss window) is
# dominated by quiet rounds, not by round cost. This asks the ONLY question
# that decides quietness -- are there new users/posts/comments/purchases past
# the state-file thresholds -- deterministically, and skips the model turn on
# an all-zero answer.
#
# Deliberately NON-RECORDING: the state file is the model round's closing
# stamp and stays untouched here. A skipped round leaves its trace as the
# 'skipped-precheck' row in task_runs; the stall detector (kanban-audit 3/b)
# reads state-staleness together with those rows.
#
# FAIL DIRECTION, spelled out: every error path here must END IN A MODEL TURN
# (non-zero exit -> runPreCheck fail-open), and only a cleanly measured
# all-zero may print SKIP. A broken precheck must never silence the sentinel.
#
# Daemon environment: the dashboard runs under launchd with a minimal PATH,
# so every binary is absolute (overridable for the hermetic tests -- the
# override envs are test seams, not configuration).
