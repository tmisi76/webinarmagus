// throws when collected under vitest, which fails the unit gate. Keep all

    // their own dependencies (the gmail fork's tests import nodemailer etc.,
    // which the root npm ci never installs) -- collecting them makes CI red
    // with zero failing tests, just three unloadable files (Marveen, #1224).
    // Running a vendor's suite is a separate workflow with the vendor's own
    // install, never this one.
    // dist/**: `npm run build` compiles every src/__tests__/*.test.ts into
    // dist/__tests__/*.test.js, and vitest collects those copies too -- measured
    // 2026-09-16: 888 files / 10723 tests instead of 444 / 5633, with 67 files
    // RED and not one real failure in them. The upgrade procedure is exactly
    // build-then-test, so this lands precisely where a red suite is least
    // affordable: either someone stops on a regression that does not exist, or
    // -- worse -- learns that "this many reds is normal", and a real failure
    // stops standing out among them.

    // watchdog-replay.py and wait for it. Measured 2026-09-04 on the v2->v4

    // suite is green. This is a timeout budget, not a behavioural change.

    //    setup file's header for the 2026-07-27 incident it prevents).
    //  - assert-supported-node: refuse to run on a Node whose ABI the installed
    //    native modules were not built for, which otherwise reds out 40 files
    //    with errors that look like bugs in those files (2026-08-17).
    //  - default-ssh-dir-seam: point WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR at a scratch directory so no
    //    test can write the operator's REAL ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Not covered by
    //    the live-install gate above: that one inspects the CHECKOUT, and ~/.ssh is
    //    HOME-scoped -- a clean worktree run leaked 62 real keys (ENROLL813,
    //    2026-09-15). A seam, not a gate: it sets state, so it lives in its own file.
