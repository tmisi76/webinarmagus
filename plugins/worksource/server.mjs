/**
 * worksource -- a Claude Code CHANNEL for machine work, not chat.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Every machine-to-machine prompt in this fleet reaches a running agent by being
 * TYPED into its tmux pane, because a live Claude Code session has no inbound
 * API. That path has a failure mode we keep paying for: if the submitting Enter
 * does not land, the text parks in the input box, and the watcher -- which can
 * only read a screen scrape -- often has no safe move. Measured on
 * agent-cortex-router (2026-08-27): two wedges in one morning, 31 and 32
 * minutes, with the Cortex queue backing up behind them.
 *
 * A channel plugin does not type. It runs alongside the agent and hands work in
 * through the same door the Telegram channel uses, where a delivery becomes a
 * real turn. No input box, so nothing to wedge; and the agent acknowledges the
 * item explicitly, so "delivered" stops meaning "we pressed some keys".
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS FIRST CUT -- deliberately small
 *
 * The queue is a DIRECTORY of JSON files, not the message bus or the Cortex API.
 * That keeps the first version provable end-to-end without touching a single
 * line of the delivery core: anything can drop a file in, and the acknowledgment
 * lands back on disk where a test can assert it. Swapping the source for the
 * real queue is a later, separate change -- and if this contract turns out to be
 * wrong, nothing has to be un-wired.
 *
 * LAYOUT (WORKSOURCE_DIR, default ~/.claude/channels/worksource/<agent>)
 *   pending/<id>.json   {"content": "...", "meta": {...}}  -- picked up, then moved
 *   active/<id>.json    in flight (handed to the agent, not yet acknowledged)
 *   done/<id>.json      acknowledged, with the agent's result attached
 *
 * A restart re-delivers whatever is in active/: an item is only finished when
 * the agent SAYS it is finished. Losing an item silently is the one outcome that
 * would make this worse than the keyboard.

// dropped -- the client is not ready to turn it into a turn yet. The item sat in
// active/ with nothing in any log to say so.

// Waiting for the client's initialized signal was the obvious fix and it was NOT
// enough: measured again after that change, the first delivery was still
// dropped. What actually rescued the item was this timeout -- requeue, hand it
// over again, and the second one landed as a turn. So the honest design rule is
// not "deliver at the right moment", it is NEVER RELY ON A SINGLE DELIVERY. That

//
// The queue is a DIRECTORY, and "anything can drop a file in" is deliberate --
// it is what makes this first cut provable without touching the delivery core.
// The cost is that an item's ORIGIN is not implied by its presence. Items the
// message router writes carry the router's own provenance (`meta.message_id` +
// `meta.from`) and their content has already been framed there by
// wrapAgentMessageForDelivery -- trusted-peer or untrusted, per the sender. A
// file dropped straight into pending/ carries neither, and would arrive looking
// exactly like a routed one.
//
// PR #1099 review (upstream, 2026-09-03), condition 1: mark such an item
// untrusted AT THE READER. This grants nobody new rights -- whoever can write
// this directory already runs as the user -- what it protects is the frame: in
// this fleet provenance has to be VISIBLE, and an unframed item silently
// borrows the credibility of a routed one.
