// ENROLL813 regression: the authorized_keys writers and the ssh-dir resolver
// must FAIL CLOSED under a test runner, instead of quietly writing the
// operator's real ~/.ssh.
//
// What went wrong (2026-09-15): `POST /api/security/bridge-enroll` calls
// bridgeEnroll() without deps, the default resolver fell back to
// homedir()/.ssh, and one branch of bridge-enroll.test.ts hits that route with a
// valid address before the file sets WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR. One full suite run =
// exactly one real `webinarMagus-remote` key. 62 of them accumulated across the fleet
// (Tecton 13, isapp06 51, pestihazak 4), and the suite was green the whole time.
//
// Two halves, and they need opposite things from the environment:
//   TEST MODE   (the first blocks) -- the guards must REFUSE the real ~/.ssh.
//   PRODUCTION  (the last block)   -- the same guards must be INERT, or this
//                                    patch would break customer pairing. That
//                                    half strips VITEST/NODE_ENV and genuinely
//                                    WRITES, because a guard whose production
//                                    behaviour is untested can silently become
//                                    a blocker, and "it has no production
//                                    behaviour" is the whole case for shipping it.
//
// Safety of this file, in BOTH halves: it never names the tester's actual home.
// process.env.HOME is redirected to a fresh scratch directory in beforeEach and
// asserted to have taken effect, so "the real ~/.ssh" every case here resolves,
// refuses, or writes IS a temp path. A regression -- or the production block
// doing its normal job -- puts the key in that temp directory, never in anyone's
// account. The environment is put back by the file-level afterEach, not by the
// block that changed it.

// blocker; the whole justification for shipping it is that it has no production
// behaviour to get wrong, so that claim is the one that needs a test.
