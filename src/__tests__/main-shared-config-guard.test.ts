// The main agent coming up on the SHARED ~/.claude must be said out loud --
// from every launch path, not just the one that happens to run in daylight.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (kanban card `guard-respawn-vak`). scripts/channels.sh
// has carried a loud regression guard since 2026-07: two triggers, both meaning
// "this boot resolved to the shared root, so the main bot rides a rotating
// credential and can 401 into a silent channel". But channels.sh is only ONE of
// the ways the main session starts. The nightly 03:00 respawn, the stage-3
// recovery resume and the hard restart all go through tmux respawn-pane and
// never touch channels.sh -- so the guard could not fire on any of them.
//
// The cost was measured, not imagined: on 2026-08-04 the main agent came up on
// the shared root at 03:00 and the outage ran until 07:58. Nothing was broken
// except the reporting. The store/channels-failures.log had no line for that
// morning, and the absence looked exactly like health.
//
// THIS FILE MEASURES THE DECISION ONLY, AND SAYS SO. A green decision test is
// not evidence that anybody calls it -- that lesson cost a full round on the
// router fix the same week (four mutations red on the predicate, a fifth that
// deleted the CALL and left all seven assertions green). The wiring assertions
// live with the call sites; what is pinned here is that the decision itself is
// right, and in particular that it stays SILENT on a stock install.
