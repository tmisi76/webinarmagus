// The post-fire watchdog's sawTurn probe, and why the config dir it is handed
// decides whether the probe can see anything at all.
//
// THE BUG (measured 2026-09-04). The in-flight entry took its configDir from
// readAgentClaudeConfigDir, which reads ONLY the `claudeConfigDir` field of
// agent-config.json. Since the fleet auth rule (2026-07-01) that field must NOT
// be set: every agent's config dir is AUTO-PROVISIONED at
// <agentDir>/.claude-config. So the read returned null, the entry stored
// `undefined`, and readTranscriptMtimeFromProjectDir fell back to
// ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-workingDir> -- a path that does not exist for
// such an agent. The probe therefore returned null on EVERY sweep, sawTurn
// stayed false, and decideTaskTimeout ruled 'lost' for any task that finished
// between two sweeps. That is every FAST task: the pane is idle before the
// injection, briefly busy, and idle again long before the next sample.
//
// The consequence was a re-fire loop with no backoff. On cortex-voip-insight it
// produced 2069 false-lost re-injections in 24 hours from a */5 task (288
// expected), a 7.5x amplification that had been running unnoticed since
// 2026-08-27 -- while `fired` rows kept the run log looking healthy.
//
// The fix reuses resolveAgentConfigDirForRead, which the context-guard and
// restart-gate runners already used for exactly this reason. These tests pin
// the mechanism (the probe can find a transcript) rather than only the call.

// THE SAME BUG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TERNARY (measured 2026-09-14).
//
// The sub-agent half above was fixed on 2026-09-04; the main-agent half kept
// hardcoding `undefined`, i.e. "the main session always writes under the shared
// ~/.claude". Main-agent config isolation made that false: the session runs
// with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<PROJECT_ROOT>/.channels-config and its transcript
// lands there instead. The probe then read a directory that had been frozen for
// days, returned null on every sweep, and sawTurn could only ever be set by a
// pane sample that happened to catch 'busy' -- which a task finishing between
// two sweeps never is.
//
// Measured on a live host over 24h: ledger-live-drain fired 2509 times against
// 720 scheduled (*/2), memoria-heartbeat 259 against ~48, running since
// 2026-09-11 with a `fired` row making every round look healthy.
//
// PR #1312 fixed this family for the channel watchdogs (probe every candidate
// root, newest wins) but did not touch the schedule runner. Its own notes
// flagged the main-agent half as latent on that host because there
// .channels-config/projects is a symlink to the shared root; where it is a real
// directory the gap is live. So the fix here is not a new rule, it is the
// existing rule applied to the caller that was left out.
