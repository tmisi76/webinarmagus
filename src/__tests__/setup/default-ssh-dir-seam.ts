// GLOBAL SUITE SEAM: no test may reach the operator's real ~/.ssh by default.
//
// ENROLL813 (2026-09-15). `POST /api/security/bridge-enroll` calls bridgeEnroll()
// with no deps, so it resolved homedir()/.ssh -- and bridge-enroll.test.ts has one
// branch ("Positive control on the same route") that hits that route BEFORE the
// file sets WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR. Every full suite run therefore enrolled exactly one
// REAL `webinarmagus-remote` key, and stayed green while doing it: the branch's only
// assertion (`not.toMatch(/Invalid host/)`) is satisfied by a SUCCESSFUL
// enrollment just as well as by the refusal it meant to rule out. 62 keys piled
// up across the fleet before anyone looked (Tecton 13, isapp06 51, pestihazak 4).
//
// Why the existing live-install gate could not have caught this -- worth stating,
// because it makes this file look redundant next to assert-not-live-install.ts:
// that gate inspects the CHECKOUT (store/.dashboard-token & co in the repo root)
// and tells you to run from a clean worktree under your HOME. But ~/.ssh is
// HOME-scoped, not checkout-scoped. Following its advice to the letter still
// wrote the operator's authorized_keys. A checkout-scoped gate cannot protect a
// home-scoped asset; this seam is the home-scoped half.
//
// This seam alone would NOT have prevented all 62 keys, and the measurement says
// so: with this file ON and the fail-closed guards OFF, the original test file
// still wrote one key to the real ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (13 tests green). The
// reason is the original afterEach, which does an unconditional
// `delete process.env.WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR` -- that drops the suite-level default
// after the first test, and the positive control then falls back to the home
// directory. Point 4 of the PR body describes the same hole; this comment used
// to contradict it.
//
// What actually holds is the combination: this seam, PLUS the afterEach that
// restores the previous value instead of deleting it, PLUS the fail-closed
// guards in src/ssh-dir.ts and src/remote-enroll-fs.ts. It is a setupFile (every
// worker, before any test module imports) rather than a per-file beforeEach
// somebody can forget, which is what gives it the reach -- not sufficiency.
//
// Scoped, not blanket: an existing WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR is respected, so a test that
// wants its own directory keeps it.
