// DESKTOPLOCKFROM918 -- the channel-inbound envelope has more than one door.
//
// #1391 gave the voice channel its own id and gated it on an enrolled device
// key, because `channel-inbound` framing tells every receiving agent "this is
// the OWNER, a reply is expected", and the shared dashboard token is readable
// by every sub-agent. That guard lives in /api/messages.
//
// Measured on the code the same morning: /api/messages is not the only writer
// into agent_messages. POST /api/desktop-lock took the body's `owner` string
// verbatim as the from_agent of a broadcast to the whole fleet -- with the
// caller's free-text `note` embedded in the content. So the shared token still
// minted an owner-framed message carrying attacker-chosen text; it just used
// the other door. The content is NOT limited to lock boilerplate, which is why
// this is a forgery and not a nuisance.
//
// The fix refuses a channel identity as a lock owner, reading the set from the
// classifier's own constant so the next channel id is covered without anyone
// remembering this file.
