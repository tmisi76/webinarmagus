// Guard for the two inviolable rules that a refactor can silently drop.
//
// Context (2026-08-27). The fleet rules baked into every generated colleague
// CLAUDE.md were split: install-agnostic hygiene moved to the global
// `fleet-hygiene` skill, owner-specific policy stayed in the generator. The
// split lost two rules on the way -- they were in neither place:
//
//   - send-approval: a colleague assistant drafts, and only the principal's
//     explicit, per-message approval may actually send anything;
//   - flag-and-wait: work that missed its window is reported to the principal,
//     not silently voided or silently made up later.
//
// Both are owner policy, not hygiene, so the skill is the wrong home for them.
// Losing the first is the expensive one: every colleague assistant handles mail,
// so an agent generated without it can mail on its principal's behalf believing
// that is the job.
//
// Nothing guarded this, which is why it survived review. The test reads the
// generator as SOURCE and asserts the prompt body still carries both rules --
// the same technique as agent-scaffold-claude-md-prompt.ts, and for the same
// reason: the regression lives in a prompt string, not in behaviour we can
// exercise without calling the LLM.
//
// If a later refactor moves these rules somewhere better, update the test to
// look there. Do not delete it: the point is that SOME place must own them.
