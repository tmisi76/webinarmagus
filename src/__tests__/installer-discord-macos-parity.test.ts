// ours was invisible -- first-class in the runtime and offered by the Linux
// installer, absent from the macOS menu and from every doc. These are
// structural anchors on the shipped files (the installer runs on a customer
// Mac where no harness can execute it end to end); each asserts one half of
// the parity, so a silent removal of any one fails the suite.
