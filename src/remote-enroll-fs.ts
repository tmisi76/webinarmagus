/**
 * ENROLL813 CHOKEPOINT -- the last line, and the only one every writer shares.
 *
 * All three exported writers below take `sshDir` as a PARAMETER, so whether the
 * real ~/.ssh gets touched is decided by the caller. That is the right shape,
 * but it means a single caller that forgets the seam can mutate the operator's
 * authorized_keys -- and one did: `POST /api/security/bridge-enroll` calls
 * bridgeEnroll() without deps, so the route's default resolver used
 * homedir()/.ssh, and a plain suite run enrolled a REAL key on every pass. The
 * test stayed GREEN throughout, because its only assertion
 * (`not.toMatch(/Invalid host/)`) is satisfied by a SUCCESSFUL enrollment too.
 * 62 keys accumulated across the fleet before anyone looked (cleaned 2026-09-15).
 *
 * The check is deliberately narrow on BOTH axes, so it cannot misfire:
 *   - only under a test runner (VITEST / NODE_ENV=test -- see test-run-marker.ts,
 *     the one definition of that question in this repo), and
 *   - only when the target IS the real ~/.ssh. A scratch directory always passes,
 *     which is every legitimate test.
 * So the guard has no production behaviour to get wrong; what it forbids is the
 * one combination that is always a mistake.
 *
 * Why here and not only in the resolvers: this is the single funnel that both
 * the HTTP routes and the CLI pass through. A guard in a resolver protects the
 * callers that USE that resolver; a guard here protects the file.
