// The ONE place that answers "which .ssh directory does this process write to?"
//
// ENROLL813 (2026-09-15). The question used to be answered in THREE places,
// and only two of them knew about the test seam:
//   src/web/bridge-enroll.ts             resolveSshDir()          -- honoured WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR
//   src/web/routes/bridge-service-ports.ts resolveSshDir()        -- byte-identical copy
//   scripts/remote-access-enroll.ts      join(homedir(), '.ssh')  -- knew NOTHING about it
// A seam that only some writers honour is not a seam. Measured consequence:
// 62 real `webinar-magus-remote` keys accumulated in operators' authorized_keys from
// ordinary test runs (Tecton 13, isapp06 51, pestihazak 4; cleaned 2026-09-15).
//
// FAIL-CLOSED RULE: under a test runner, resolving to the REAL ~/.ssh is a bug,
// never an intent. A suite that means to exercise enrollment points
// WEBINAR_MAGUS_SSH_DIR at a scratch directory -- and since
// src/__tests__/setup/default-ssh-dir-seam.ts sets a per-worker default, a test
// only reaches this throw by unsetting the seam on purpose. Writing the
// operator's authorized_keys instead is precisely what this module exists to stop.
//
// Production is unaffected: neither VITEST nor NODE_ENV=test exists in a live
// install (measured 2026-09-15 on isapp06 -- .env, the systemd units and every
// running webinar-magus process: zero occurrences). If the guard ever DOES fire in
// production it would break real device pairing, so every message names the
// signal that triggered it and the one variable that resolves it.
