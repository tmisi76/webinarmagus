/**
 * EVIDGUARD818: the secret gate's pure core.
 *
 * Why it exists: on 2026-07-22 an ElevenLabs API key reached this PUBLIC repo in
 * commit 48638cb6. It was not written into code -- it sat inside a QUOTED
 * TELEGRAM MESSAGE in our own `.pre-ship-evidence` artifact. Nothing looked at
 * that file, because nothing looked at anything. The key is dead and that case
 * is closed; this module closes the mechanism.
 *
 * Three detectors, because any one of them alone would have missed it:
 *   1. PATH      -- evidence/artifact directories have no business in the repo.
 *   2. CONTENT   -- known secret shapes (sk_live_, private keys, JWTs, ...).
 *   3. TRANSCRIPT-- channel material (message_id NNN: "...") regardless of what
 *                   it quotes. This is the one that would have caught the 2026-07
 *                   leak even though nobody had listed the ElevenLabs key format.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED is the rule, not a mode: an empty file set, an unreadable file, a
 * file too large to scan -- each is a FAILURE with a named reason, never a pass.
 * A silent skip reads as "scanned and clean", which is the failure mode that let
 * the original leak through.

 * A fixture exception: ONE secret-shaped literal, in ONE test file, cleared by

 * synthetic secrets (the gate's own tests), and the wrong one for an ordinary
 * test file that happens to need one key-shaped literal: from then on nothing
 * in it is checked, including the parts nobody was thinking about.
 *
 * Found on PR #628 (2026-09-06). Two costops collector tests carry an `sk-`
 * shaped fixture, and both literals are load-bearing: one drives the assertion
 * that a RAW secret in `secret_ref` must be rejected in favour of a `vault:`
 * reference, the other drives "the secret never reaches the report". Replacing
 * them with a neutral string would leave the tests passing while measuring
 * something weaker than their names claim. Blinding both whole files to keep
 * two lines is the other bad trade. Hence this: the narrowest exception that
 * still lets the gate do its job.
 *
 * THE KEY IS A HASH OF THE MATCHED TEXT, NOT A LINE NUMBER AND NOT THE LITERAL.
 *  - A line number goes stale the moment anyone edits above it, and a stale
 *    exception either stops working or, worse, starts covering a different line.
 *  - The literal itself cannot live here: this file is scanned too, and writing
 *    a secret shape into the scanner to excuse a secret shape elsewhere is how
 *    the exception becomes the leak.
 *  - A hash is exact and fails closed: change the fixture and the exception
 *    simply stops applying, so the gate goes red and a human looks again.
